### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**OregSamSas/OregSamSas** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->
I'm _Oreg Sam_, or _Sam Oreg_, both order are kinda right (almost equal), becuase Oreg and Sam, both are just nicknames, you can decide which one would like you to use to call/refer to me. 
I'm mostly active on Scratch. There I am _simiagain_, you can see my profile here: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/simiagain/

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** translating the _Scratch Addons_ website into hungarian
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning** coding in Java (and also in Python, but that Java-thing is a very recent decision)
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about** anything you want, but I can't guarantee that I'll also give any respond. So take the questions that you think that I'll answer.
- ðŸ“« **How to reach me:** on Scratch, here, or on Discord, or maybe on Transifex now ðŸ˜€ (but excuse me it's quite hard to reach me sometimes)
- ðŸ˜„ **Pronouns:** **he**/his/him or also with they (but I can say I won't be furious if you mistype it **by an accident**)
- âš¡ **Fun fact:** I like animals (mostly birds and sea mammels, like orcas, whales, and seals), I play both on cello, and piano, I'm also a Battle for Wesnoth add-on creator, and I like Chemistry
